# Soundbath 2.1
Soundbath is a data sonification of live rainfall data from England, Scotland, and Wales. The data updates every 15 minutes and is sonified using an RNBO web export. The max patch containing the RNBO module is contained within.

The project takes real-time data from:
Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairsâ€™ Rainfall API data API:
https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/rainfall

Natural Resources Wales:
https://api-portal.naturalresources.wales/api-details#api=open-data-river-level-rainfall
-and-sea-data-api&operation=historicaldataforstationparameter

SEPA(Scotland):

The page is currently hosted as a GitHub Page:

The original version of this project was a collaboration between myself, Anna Dowell, Lauren Scott, and Imran Muhammed. The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/annadowell/soundbath2

This version has been slightly debugged for stability and has an updated RNBO patch to better aid functionality.
